The YC-20 is a divide-down combo organ designed in the late 60's. This emulation faithfully copies the features, sounds and flaws of the original organ.

## Version 1.3.0 released on January 28th 2011 ##

This release brings forth **Windows and OS X VSTi plugins with the proper GUI**. There are no changes to the Linux release except for some gui code refactoring.

Thanks to all the testers and Robin Gareus for all the work on the OS X release, especially for the VSTi.

### Features: ###
  * Physical modelling, no polyphony restrictions
  * 61 keys
  * Two main voice sections
  * Switchable bass section
  * A realism control to add flaws found in the real organ

### Flaws: ###
  * Takes quite a bit of CPU power
  * No touch vibrato

The emulation is written in Faust. The standalone application uses Jack for audio and MIDI and is available for Linux Windows and OS X. There is a LV2 plugin for Linux and a VST for OS X and Windows.
